This is my basic script for working on pwn challenges.
Feel free to use it.

If you wish to make your life even easier, go ahead and use the generate_script.py
All you have to do is to add an: alias SCRIPT="python /home/<path>/generate_script.py" in your .bashrc
Next, go in the directory where the binary is and enter: SCRIPT -b <binary_name>

Good Luck!
