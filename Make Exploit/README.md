This is my basic script for working on pwn challenges.


The way I designed this tool to be used is to set an alias as follows:
```bash
alias SCRIPT="python /home/<path>/generate_script.py"
```
Then, whenever you want to generate a script, run the following command: `SCRIPT -b binary_name -l library_name.so -ip 127.0.0.1 -p 1337` inside a tmux terminal and you will be able to split the terminal in two halfs to debug the process.

The program is capable to identify the binary format, extract all PLT and GOT entries from the binary and look them up in the libc to identify their offset. It can also extract rop gadgets from both the libc and the binary as well as offsets for `__malloc_hook` / `__free_hook` and one gadgets from libc. 

Feel free to use it.

### TODO
- Automatically identify `rwx` memory.
- Automatically identify `format string` vulnerabilities
