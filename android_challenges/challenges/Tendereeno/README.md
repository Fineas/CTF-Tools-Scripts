- Description: **While running away from Frank Ht. Six, an angry friend of Tom’s, R-boy jumps into the time machine. He’s spat out in 2019: a year where social media platforms are widespread in society. Nowadays, you’re no one without a social network account. Among all the new wannabe social networks, one in particular catches R-Boy’s attention. A sneaky guy on the other side of the street starts yelling at R-Boy: "You! Quick! You must install the Tendereeno app immediately to uncover its hidden secrets, or we’re all doomed!" It's time to help R-Boy understand what's happening behind the screen of this mobile application. If its functionalities aren't exposed, the year 2020 may be full of catastrophic events such as a global pandemic, a new world war, rampant bushfires and who knows what else!**
